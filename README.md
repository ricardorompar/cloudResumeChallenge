## Cloud Resume Challenge

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a "spec" developed by <a href="https://github.com/forrestbrazeal">Forrest Brazeal</a>. It's a series of steps that one can do to prove different skills such as basic web and API development, managing infrastructure, CI/CD, etc. 

These are the steps that I should take in order to complete the CRC:
- [ ] 1. AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification
- [ ] 2. HTML resume
- [ ] 3. Styling with CSS
- [ ] 4. Deploying the static website in an S3 bucket
- [ ] 5. Use CloudFront to use TLS certificates for secure connections.
- [ ] 6. Custom domain name with Route53
- [ ] 7. Visitor counter with JS
- [ ] 8. Counter value stored in DynamoDB
- [ ] 9. API to update the DB value with a Lambda function
- [ ] 10. API tests
- [ ] 11. Infrastructure as Code
- [ ] 12. CI/CD
- [ ] 13. Automatically updating the bucket
- [ ] 14. Blog post

In this case, as you can see, I have chosen the AWS version of the cloud services. Any other cloud provider services would work as well.
