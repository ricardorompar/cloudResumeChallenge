                <Card.Body>
                        I am a dedicated and results-driven engineer with a strong passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. Graduating top of my cohort, I have proven my ability to excel academically, collaborate with my peers and apply my knowledge practically. Pursuing a Master of Computer Science Iâ€™m learning to integrate different technologies (like Flask, React, AWS, GCP, etc.) to create tools and apps that can serve people.
                        <br/>
                        I am currently learning about the cloud, AWS/GCP, K8s, containerized apps, cloud security, CI/CD, IaC with Terraform, etc.
