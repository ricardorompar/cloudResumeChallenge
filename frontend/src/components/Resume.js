                        I am a dedicated and results-driven engineer with a strong passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. Graduating top of my cohort, I have proven my ability to excel academically, collaborate with my peers and apply my knowledge practically. Pursuing a Master of Computer Science Iâ€™m learning to integrate different technologies (like Flask, React, AWS, GCP, etc.) to create tools and apps that can serve people.
